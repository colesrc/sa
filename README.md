Stick Arena auto-account generator using Python. You can use it to raid StickArena lobby!

NOTE: This bypasses the languagefilter for Stick Arena. This project is not mine btw, I stole it from anubis.

Also... it's connecting VIA tor on 127.0.0.1:9050 so if you're not using TOR you must use your own proxy or public ipaddress (bad idea if you want to get banned...lols. I raided and got banned on all accounts -.-)

Input your desired IP & PORT in the lines "socks.setdefaultproxy(socks.PROXY_TYPE_SOCKS5, '127.0.0.1', 9050)"
